# In this assignment, you'll be using the domain model from hw1 (found in the hw1-solution.sql file)
# to create the database structure for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database).
# The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the top-billed
# cast for each movie in the database.

# To run this file, run the following command at your terminal prompt:
# `rails runner kmdb.rb`

# Requirements/assumptions
#
# - There will only be three movies in the database â€“ the three films
#   that make up Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy
# - Movie data includes the movie title, year released, MPAA rating,
#   and director
# - A movie has a single director
# - A person can be the director of and/or play a role in a movie
# - Everything you need to do in this assignment is marked with TODO!

# Rubric
# 
# There are three deliverables for this assignment, all delivered within
# this repository and submitted via GitHub and Canvas:
# - Generate the models and migration files to match the domain model from hw1.
#   Execute the migration files to create the tables in the database. Add the
#   relevant association methods in each model. (5 points)
# - Insert the "Batman" sample data using ruby code. Do not use hard-coded ids and
#   delete any existing data beforehand so that each run of this script does not
#   create duplicate data. (5 points)
# - Query the data and loop through it to display output similar to the following
#   sample "report". (10 points)

# Submission
# 
# - "Use this template" to create a brand-new "hw2" repository in your
#   personal GitHub account, e.g. https://github.com/<USERNAME>/hw2
# - Do the assignment, committing and syncing often
# - When done, commit and sync a final time, before submitting the GitHub
#   URL for the finished "hw2" repository as the "Website URL" for the 
#   Homework 2 assignment in Canvas

# Successful sample output is as shown:

##Creating varibale to reference christopher nolan
ChristopherNolan = Person.where({ name: "Christopher Nolan" })[0]
puts ChristopherNolan.id


##Adding in movies into the Movie table
batman1 = Movie.new
batman1.title = "Batman Begins"
batman1.year_released = "2005"
batman1.rated = "PG-13"
batman1.person_id  = ChristopherNolan.id

batman3 = Movie.new
batman3.title = "The Dark Knight"
batman3.year_released = "2012"
batman3.rated = "PG-13"
batman3.person_id  = ChristopherNolan.id
batman3.save


##Adding role into the Roles Table
role = role.new
role.movie_id = 
role.person_id =
role.character_name =
role.save


##creating loops
puts "There are #{Movie.all.count} movies."

movies = Movie.where({ person_id: ChristopherNolan.id })
puts movies

puts "Movies: #{movies.count}"
for movie in movies
  puts "#{movie.title}"
end

movies = ChristopherNolan.movies

puts "Movies: #{movies.count}"
for movie in movies
  puts "#{movie.title}"
end
